Conflict Resolution
Concepts
1. Origin (Last declaration wins)
2. Merge  (Declaration merge, Merge effect from different origin)
3. Inheritance (Property specifies on the parent will be inherit by its childs and beyond)
4. Specificity (Most Specific slector wins)
   Specificity Score
   a. style=""
   b. ID
   c. Class or pseudo class
   d. # of element tag
   e. !important - ovewrites Specificity

Styling Text
1. font-family
2. color: #(hexadecimal) (RRGGBB)
3. font-style: (italic)
4. font-weight: (0-900 or bold)
5. font-size: (default is 16px)
6. text-transform: (capitalize , lowercase etc)
7. Text-align: (ex: center, right justified etc)

relative font-sizing (no overwrite, instead accumulated)
to overwrite need to decrease the size
1. Percent - percent of default
2. em - relative to letter m of the font currently in used
3. rem - value x 16px

Box Model
1.content
2.padding
3.border

Use percent width to makethe content become responsive 


Relative and Absolute Positioning

Media Queries (a style sheet within the style sheet)
Basic syntax

   p{

   }
}

1. max-width (common)
2. min-width (common)
3. orientation
4. screen
4. print

can be combined by logical operators (and, or(,))
*dont overlap boundaries
base style first before media query
